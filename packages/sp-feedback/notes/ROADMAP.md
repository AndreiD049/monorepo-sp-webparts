# Still to be implemented

- [ ] Add tags to the item template.
      ```
          When clicking on a tag, it should show a list of items that also have that tag.
          When clicking on an item, it should show up in a modal window.
      ```
- [ ] Board view, with drag and drop (see: https://react-dnd.github.io/react-dnd/docs/tutorial#adding-drag-and-drop-interaction)
- [ ] Implement a modal window to display an item (usually when clicking on a link)
- [ ] Improve the UI of creating and new item
- [ ] Document the difference Item types (like 'FB:/Application' or 'FB:/Saved_View') and explain their purpose
- [ ] Support attachments with the feedback item. How can i then display attachments in the item template
- [ ] Send notifications when an item gains a certain status (ex: *Implemented* or *Finished*)
