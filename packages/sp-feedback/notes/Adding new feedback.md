# Adding a new feedback item

When adding new feedback item, what information i need from the user?
* A summary/description of the problem/feature
* Where the problem occured
* What are the steps required to reproduce the problem
* Does the problem block other feature testing
* Additional links and screenshots related to the problem/feedback
* Attachments

# What if the feedback was already given?

We don't want to have a lot of duplicated feedbacks. Do users need to see if a similar feedback was already provided? If they see the same feedback they had, they can subscribe to it to see when the feature is implemented, or maybe provide more details in the description (as comments?).

# Or...

We allow the user to submit all the feedbacks they want, without showing them if it was already given. Then the person responsible for reviewing feedbacks can group them. Grouped items will not clutter the views and all internal feedbacks can then be viewed as modals when clicking on them
